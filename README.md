Web scrapers using Node.js

I learn web scraping and experiment things using Node.js modules like `cheerio` and `express`.

1. cricbuzz-scrap: Logs IPL Cricket score from cricbuzz into a text file as well as on console.
2. cricbuzz-scrap-automated: Works pretty much same as above but now with built-in IPL timetable which uses system date and according chooses unique match ID. Fully automated.
3. google-scrap1: Searches string input given from command line and gives related searches (if possible; currently one string)
4. google-scrap2: Giving search strings via command line arguments while running this script, it searches Google for that string(s) and finds top keywords associated with that search strings.
